# DrumKit
This is my take on the Drum Kit challenge from the App Brewery's bootcamp. Clicking on the image of a drum or typing its corresponding letter will result in the drum's sound being played and a simple animation as feedback to the user. I followed along with the tutorial as event listeners, objects, methods, and various other topics were covered. I tried to build out sections on my own prior to the tutorial showing me and implemented the instructor's method when I deemed it to be better.
